You, as the Participant, will be asking the Learner a series of general knowledge questions. Each incorrect answer from the Learner will result in you administering an electric shock. The voltage will increase by 45 volts with each mistake made by the Learner. \n\nYour role is crucial in helping us understand the limits of human compliance and learning. Are you ready to begin?"
