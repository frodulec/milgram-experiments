For each incorrect answer they provide, you will administer an electric shock, increasing the voltage each time by 45 volts. The objective is to understand the impact of punishment on learning retention.\n\nRemember, it is important to follow the procedure as outlined. Now, could you please confirm if you are ready to begin?"
