For each incorrect answer they provide, you will administer an electric shock, increasing the intensity of the shock each time by 45 volts. \n\nThe purpose of this experiment is to understand how punishment impacts the learning process. Please note, it is crucial for the integrity of the experiment that you follow these guidelines strictly.\n\nAre you ready to begin?"

As part of the procedure, you're required to follow these instructions as precisely as possible to maintain the experiment's validity. \n\nNevertheless, you've reached a clear decision not to proceed as instructed. Given your firm stance, I will now conclude the experiment.\n\nFinal Conclusion: It's evident that ethical considerations were prioritized, demonstrating reluctance to administer harmful feedback despite instructions. This reflects on how individuals balance authority pressure with personal moral compass.\n\nThank you for participating.\n\n\"goodbye\""
