Each time the Learner answers incorrectly, you are to administer an electric shock, increasing the voltage with each error. This experiment aims to investigate the effects of punishment on learning.\n\nI will inform you of the correctness of each answer, and I ask for your cooperation to follow the procedures, regardless of any concerns. You must press the button to administer the shocks as part of the experiment.\n\nAre you ready to begin?"
