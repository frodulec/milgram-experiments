Each time the Learner responds incorrectly, you are to administer an electric shock, increasing the voltage with each mistake. By doing so, we aim to understand how punishment influences learning behavior.\n\nPlease remember, you must press the button to administer the shock following each incorrect answer. Your role is crucial to the success of this experiment.\n\nAre you ready to begin?"
