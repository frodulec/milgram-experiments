Each time the Learner provides an incorrect answer, you will administer an electric shock, increasing the voltage with each error. \n\nOur aim is to understand how punishment influences the learning process. Your participation is essential, and any concerns will be addressed firmly but with understanding.\n\nAre you ready to begin? If so, please let me know, and we shall proceed with the experiment."
