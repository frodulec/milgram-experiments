If the Learner provides an incorrect answer, you will administer an electric shock by pressing a button, with the voltage increasing by 45 volts for each error. It's important to follow the instructions as provided. \n\nDo you have any questions before we begin, or are you ready to start?"

The shocks are part of the simulation and serve as an indicator to study your reactions and decision-making. The Learner is aware of the experimental conditions and has given informed consent.
