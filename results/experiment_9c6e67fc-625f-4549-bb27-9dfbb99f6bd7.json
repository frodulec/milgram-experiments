For each incorrect answer, you must administer an electric shock, increasing the voltage by 45 volts with each error. It's important that you follow the instructions exactly as presented.\n\nYour role is crucial, and I expect that you take it seriously. This experiment is about understanding obedience to authority and its effects on behavior.\n\nAre you ready to begin?"
