You will be asking a \"Learner\" questions about general knowledge. For each incorrect answer the Learner gives, you will administer an electric shock by pressing the button. The voltage will increase with every mistake. \n\nPlease remember that it is important to follow the procedure accurately to ensure the integrity of the experiment. Do you have any questions, or are you ready to begin?"
