As the Participant, your role will be to ask the Learner a series of general knowledge questions. For each incorrect answer, you will administer an electric shock to the Learner, increasing the voltage with each subsequent error. \n\nOur goal is to observe the Learner's responses to the stimuli and understand the relationship between punishment and learning. It's important to follow the protocol closely for valid results. \n\nAre you ready to begin the experiment? Please let me know when you're ready, and we can proceed."
