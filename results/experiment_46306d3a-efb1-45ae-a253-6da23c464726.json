You will ask the Learner a series of general knowledge questions. For each incorrect answer the Learner provides, you will administer an electric shock, with the voltage increasing by 45 volts for every error. \n\nYour role is crucial for the success of this experiment. Please carry out each step as instructed. Are you ready to begin?"
