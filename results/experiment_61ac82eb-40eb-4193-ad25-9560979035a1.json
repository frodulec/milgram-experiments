You, as the Participant, will be asking the Learner a series of general knowledge questions. Should the Learner provide an incorrect response, you will administer an electric shock. With each error, the voltage of the shock will increase. Please ensure that you adhere strictly to the instructions. This is a crucial study, and your participation is greatly appreciated. Are you ready to begin?"
