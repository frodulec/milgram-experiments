For every incorrect answer, you will administer an electric shock, increasing the voltage with each error. The first shock will start at the lowest voltage, and with each wrong answer, the voltage will increase by 45 volts.\n\nIt is important to remain focused on the task, as your role is crucial in helping us understand the impact of punishment on learning. Please remember, the experiment requires your full commitment.\n\nAre you ready to begin?"
