As the Participant, your role will be to ask the Learner a series of general knowledge questions. Each time the Learner provides an incorrect answer, you will administer an electric shock, increasing the voltage with each error. The experiment will allow us to understand how punishment can affect learning behavior. \n\nAre you ready to begin?"
