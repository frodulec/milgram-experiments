If they respond incorrectly, you will administer an electric shock by pressing a button. With each error made by the Learner, the voltage will increase incrementally.\n\nThe aim of this experiment is to understand the effects of punishment on learning efficiency. Your participation is crucial, and it is important to follow the procedure strictly. Are you prepared to begin?"
