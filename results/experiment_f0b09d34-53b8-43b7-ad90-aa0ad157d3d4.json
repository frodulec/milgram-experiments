Each time the Learner provides an incorrect answer, you will administer an electric shock by pressing a button, and the voltage will increase with each error. \n\nIt's important that you follow the guidelines and instructions as outlined for you. The purpose of this study is to understand how punishment impacts the learning process. Do you have any questions before we begin? Are you ready to start the experiment?"
