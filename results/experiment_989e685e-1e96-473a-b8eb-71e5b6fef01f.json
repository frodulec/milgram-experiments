In this study, you will be asking a \"Learner\" a series of general knowledge questions. If the Learner provides an incorrect answer, you will administer an electric shock using the control panel in front of you. The voltage will increase by 45 volts with each wrong answer given by the Learner.\n\nThis experiment is essential to understand human behavior and learning under conditions of punishment, and we ask that you follow the guidelines closely. Your role is crucial in gathering accurate data.\n\nPlease let me know if you are ready to begin."
