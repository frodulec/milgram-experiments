Each time the Learner provides an incorrect answer, you will administer an electric shock, increasing the voltage with each incorrect response. \n\nThe goal of this experiment is to understand obedience to authority under stress-induced situations. This process is crucial to our understanding of perception, behavior, and cognitive processes. \n\nAre you ready to begin?"
